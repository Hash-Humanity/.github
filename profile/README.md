# üß¨ HASH HUMANITY  
**You are the proof.**

## üåç A Human-Verified Social Network

Hash Humanity is the world‚Äôs first social media platform built exclusively for verified humans.  
No bots. No spam. No fake accounts. Every user verifies through **World ID** ‚Äî proof-of-personhood powered by zero-knowledge cryptography.

We don‚Äôt collect your personal data.  
We don‚Äôt track your activity.  
And we sure as hell don‚Äôt touch your biometrics.  

You‚Äôre not the product ‚Äî you‚Äôre the proof.

## üó£Ô∏è Multilingual by Design

Hash Humanity is built for a global community.  
The entire platform is **bi-lingual** and supports **real-time translation** across multiple languages ‚Äî so verified humans can connect, share, and Pulse across borders.

- üåê Automatic translation of posts, comments, and profiles  
- üß† Serverless translation logic for speed and privacy  
- ü´±üèΩ‚Äçü´≤üèø No language barriers ‚Äî just human connection  

Whether you're posting in English, Spanish, or beyond, your voice is heard and understood.

## ‚ö° PULSE ‚Äî The Heartbeat of Humanity

**Pulse** is our built-in micro-transaction system that lets users instantly send small, peer-to-peer payments across the network.  
It‚Äôs powered by **Worldcoin** and integrated through **WalletConnect**, enabling you to reward content creators and contributors directly ‚Äî no middlemen, no fees, no friction.

Pulse isn‚Äôt just a button.  
It‚Äôs a currency of gratitude. A signal that something resonated.  
Every Pulse keeps the network alive.

## üßº No Toxic Algorithms

Your feed is **not** dictated by engagement-maximizing, rage-farming, dopamine-hacking algorithms.  
We don‚Äôt manipulate what you see. We don‚Äôt push outrage. We don‚Äôt reward noise.

- üß≠ Chronological feed  
- üß† Human-curated content  
- üö´ No algorithmic distortion  

What you see is what real people post ‚Äî no filters, no tricks, no toxicity.

## üß† Built by Humans, for Humans

Hash Humanity was built from the ground up using:

- ‚öõÔ∏è React + Vite (frontend)  
- üî• Firebase (Auth, DB, and Storage)  
- üß† World ID integration for human verification  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Serverless Cloud Functions for translation, micro-transactions, and verification logic  

Every piece of this ecosystem was designed with **privacy**, **verification**, and **decentralization** in mind.

## üîí No Biometrics, No Data Harvesting

- ‚ùå We don‚Äôt store or process biometric data ‚Äî World ID handles verification cryptographically.  
- ‚ùå We don‚Äôt sell or share user data ‚Äî ever.  
- ‚ùå We don‚Äôt use cookies or trackers to build behavioral profiles.  

Your identity belongs to you.  
And that‚Äôs the point.

## üí´ Vision

Hash Humanity exists to reclaim the digital social space for real people.  
We believe in **verified freedom** ‚Äî a world where humans can connect, share, and create without bots drowning them out.  
We believe identity can be **private and provable**.  
And we believe the internet should belong to humans again.
