# üß¨ Hash Humanity

**Verified humans only. No bots. No burners. No BS.**

Hash Humanity is a World ID‚Äìonly social platform with a strict door policy:  
**If you‚Äôre not verified human, you‚Äôre not getting in.**

That one rule changes everything.

## üö´ No Bots. No Spam. No Noise.

This isn‚Äôt another engagement farm. When every account is cryptographically verified as human, the feed becomes pure signal. No fake followers. No rage bait. No sludge. Just real people saying real things ‚Äî and getting rewarded for it.

## ‚ö° Pulse: Micro-Rewards for Big Ideas

We‚Äôre most hyped about **Pulse** ‚Äî a built-in micro-reward powered by Worldcoin.  
It‚Äôs not likes. It‚Äôs not vanity metrics. It‚Äôs **money for ideas**.

- üí∏ Drop real value on posts that move you  
- üß† Reward sharp thinking, not low-effort sludge  
- ü§ù Create a merit economy between verified humans  

Pulse turns every post into a chance to earn ‚Äî not from ads, but from appreciation.

## üîê World ID: Proof-of-Personhood, Not Surveillance

We use [World ID](https://worldcoin.org/world-id) to verify humanity ‚Äî privately, securely, and without compromise.

- ‚úÖ No biometrics stored  
- ‚úÖ No creepy KYC  
- ‚úÖ No centralized identity tracking  

Every reply, follow, and Pulse happens between **real people you can trust are real**.

## üöÄ Built for Brains. Designed to Reward.

We‚Äôre in beta. The rails are solid. The culture is simple:

> **Bring your brain. Get rewarded.**

Hash Humanity is where intelligent conversation meets instant incentive.  
If you want your thoughts to actually matter ‚Äî and pay ‚Äî get in, verify, and **Pulse the hell out of what deserves it.**
